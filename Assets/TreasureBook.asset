      aside potential predators. The Stegalomaniac is known for its fantastical coloring,
      its mirror-like eyes, and its incredible aggressive nature. It assaults the

      it will chase down predators for sport. '

      is surprisingly mobile, though slow. It can navigate up nearly vertical surfaces

      prefer to travel at night, when they are best camouflaged, but are so slow
      that they are often still climbing by the time day comes around, making them

      forms, though it always reverts to a reptilian state upon death. It is terrifyingly
      relentless, unable to give up a chase once it starts running. The most common

      due to exhaustion or following its prey off a cliff. '

      are very good killers. '

      The Braunt is incredibly tough to kill, even when caught, and shrugs off most
